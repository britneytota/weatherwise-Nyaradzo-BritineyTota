Utilized AI Tools 
During the project's development lifecycle, I extensively leveraged ChatGPT's abilities as a helpful AI assistant. Its contributions covered several essential areas, offering substantial assistance in: developing modular and reusable functions, particularly the get_weather_data() function aimed at effective data retrieval, and producing meaningful data visualizations, which together facilitated the formation of a straightforward, concise, and easily verifiable report on the weather details. Additionally, the AI model provided essential insights and actionable suggestions regarding the challenges of integrating external APIs, facilitating smooth data integration, and on the thoughtful design of an attractive and intuitive menu interface that improves the overall user experience of the application. 

Techniques for Prompting Utilized
To optimally utilize the features of ChatGPT, I used various prompting methods, each designed to obtain particular kinds of help and information. These methods encompassed: 1. Asking about the basic structure of each element of the project, looking for essential understanding and structural direction. 

What Worked Well?
 One specific feature of the project that I take particular pride in is the effective deployment of the natural language query parser. This function allows users to engage with the application in a more intuitive and human-like way, enabling them to ask about weather details using natural language inquiries like “What will tomorrow's temperature be in London?” The system's capability to handle these inquiries and deliver an appropriate and precise weather forecast response greatly improved the perceived intelligence and overall usability of the application. It was an especially rewarding accomplishment to merge core concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with real-time data from APIs to generate truly helpful and contextually appropriate answers to user questions. 

What Would I Do Differently ?
Considering the development process, one aspect I would certainly handle differently in upcoming projects is the improvement of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) parser. Although the existing implementation offers fundamental capabilities, I see considerable opportunities for enhancement. In particular, I would seek to integrate a more advanced and resilient NLP library to enable deeper and more detailed sentence analysis. This would allow the application to comprehend a broader array of user inquiries, manage more intricate linguistic formats, and possibly interpret user intent with greater precision, resulting in a more fluid and clever user engagement. 

Final Thoughts 
This initiative has been a significant educational experience, showcasing the complex procedure of integrating different technological components—such as external APIs for data gathering, advanced data visualization methods for displaying information, and user-friendly interaction design—into a single, cohesive application. Moreover, it has strongly highlighted the vital function that AI tools like ChatGPT can serve in speeding up the software development cycle and enhancing my comprehension of the complexities present in each element of
One aspect I'm proud of is the natural language query parser. Enabling users to inquire with questions such as “What’s tomorrow's temperature in London?” and providing an appropriate weather forecast response made the app seem more intelligent and user-friendly. It was fulfilling to integrate fundamental NLP with API information to produce useful responses.
