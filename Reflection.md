AI Tools Used

I utilized ChatGPT to work on this project.It provided help with: Creating modular functions such as get_weather_data() and visualizations, which created a clear and verifiable report.
Chat GPT offered advice on incorporating external APIs and designing an engaging menu. 

Prompting Techniques
I used differnt techniques such as 
1.inquiring about how to construct each component of the project
2.Requesting examples: Prompting for function examples or code snippets.
3.Iterative refinement: Providing partial code and asking for improvements or bug fixes.
4.Scenario-based queries: Asking how to handle different user inputs or API responses.

What Worked Well?

One aspect I'm proud of is the natural language query parser. Enabling users to inquire with questions such as “What’s tomorrow's temperature in London?” and providing an appropriate 
weather forecast response made the app seem more intelligent and user-friendly. It was fulfilling to integrate fundamental NLP with API information to produce useful responses.

What Would You Do Differently?
Somethinhg that l  would definitely do differently is Improve the NLP parser by incorporating a library for stronger sentence analysis. 

Final Thoughts

This project showed me how to combine various elements—APIs, data visualization, and user interaction—into a unified application.It further emphasized how AI tools such as ChatGPT can speed
up development and aid my understanding of each component.
