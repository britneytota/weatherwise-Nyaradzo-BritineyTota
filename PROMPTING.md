Me:I want to build a Python app that fetches weather data and visualizes it.Can you help me start?

  AI-Sure! Let’s begin by installing necessary packages like requests, matplotlib, and maybe pyinputplus for user menus. You’ll also need to set up API access. Here's the starter setup:

python
Copy
Edit
!pip install fetch-my-weather
!pip install hands-on-ai
!pip install pyinputplus
import os, requests, pyinputplus as pyip, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
os.environ['HANDS_ON_AI_SERVER'] = 'http://ollama.serveur.au'
os.environ['HANDS_ON_AI_MODEL'] = 'granite3.2'
os.environ['HANDS_ON_AI_API_KEY'] = input('Enter your API key: ')

  MMe: I want to build a simple script to show temperature and precipitation for a location over the next few days. What’s a lightweight way to fetch weather data?

AI: A good lightweight option is wttr.in, which returns JSON data with current conditions and forecasts. You can access it like this: https://wttr.in/London?format=j1

Me: Great, I’ll use that. Can you sketch a function to get weather data for any city?

AI: Sure, here's a function using `requests` to fetch JSON weather data for a given city:

```python
def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print("Error:", e)
        return None

Me: Perfect. Now I want to plot both temperature and precipitation for the next 3 days. Can you help with the logic?

AI: Yes! You can loop through the next 3 days, collect max/min temperatures and precipitation (e.g., from the morning forecast), then plot them using matplotlib. Here's a possible function:

python
Copy
Edit
def display_temperature_and_precipitation(weather_data):
    # code to extract and plot data here...
Me: Could you combine it all and ensure the precipitation is in mm and clearly labeled?

AI: Absolutely! Here’s the complete version with labels, markers, and line styles for clarity.

### ✅ Summary

- **Core Functions Used**: `get_weather_data`, `display_temperature_and_precipitation`
- **Visuals**: Line plot showing max/min temperature and precipitation
- **Weather Source**: `wttr.in` JSON API
- **AI Techniques Demonstrated**:
  - Problem restating
  - Requesting modular code
  - Pseudocode to full implementation
  - Requesting improvements to visual clarity

Would you like this turned into a Colab notebook or a version that works with OpenWeatherMap and an API key?

Me: Can I see how you’d structure that plotting code?

AI: Sure! Here's a function to plot max/min temperatures and precipitation (morning reading):

python
Copy
Edit
def display_temperature_and_precipitation(weather_data):
    # code extracts the first 3 days, plots temperatures and precipitation
Me: What if the user enters a wrong or misspelled city? I want the script to handle that nicely.

AI: Good idea. The current code already catches request exceptions. You could also check if the response contains expected keys like 'weather' before proceeding to plot.

Me: I'd like to give the user the option to select how many days to view — maybe 1 to 3. Can we make it flexible?

AI: Yes, we can prompt the user for the number of days (with a max of 3) and slice the data accordingly. Here's how:

python
Copy
Edit
num_days = int(input("Enter number of forecast days (1-3): "))
days = weather_data['weather'][:num_days]
Me: Nice! I also want the plot to include a grid, a clear title, and maybe a different marker for precipitation.

AI: Done. You can use marker='o' for temperature and marker='x' with linestyle='--' for precipitation. Add plt.grid(True) and a title like "3-Day Forecast".

Me: Could we add units to the Y-axis label so it says something like "Values (°C / mm)"?

AI: Absolutely! Just modify the Y-axis label:

python
Copy
Edit
plt.ylabel("Values (°C / mm)")
Me: I want to turn this into a script I can share with others. What should I add?

AI: Add a main() function, some inline comments, and use if __name__ == "__main__": main() to keep it modular. You might also add a requirements list like:

text
Copy
Edit
# requirements.txt
requests
matplotlib
Me: What if I want to log all requests and errors to a file?

AI: Add logging using Python’s logging module:

python
Copy
Edit
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='weather_log.txt', level=logging.INFO)
Then log events like:

python
Copy
Edit
logging.info(f"User requested weather for {location}")
logging.error(f"Failed to fetch data: {e}")

Me: Now that the core is working, I want to add a summary — like a quick text overview of the weather.

AI: Great idea. You can generate a brief summary using the API’s "avgtempC", "maxtempC", and "hourly" precipitation values. Here’s a simple summary generator:

python
Copy
Edit
def generate_summary(data, location):
    summary = f"Weather summary for {location}:\n"
    for day in data['weather'][:3]:
        date = day['date']
        max_temp = day['maxtempC']
        min_temp = day['mintempC']
        total_precip = sum(float(h['precipMM']) for h in day['hourly'])
        summary += f"{date}: High {max_temp}°C, Low {min_temp}°C, Precip: {total_precip:.1f} mm\n"
    return summary
