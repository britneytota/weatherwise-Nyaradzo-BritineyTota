Me: Perfect. Now I want to plot both temperature and precipitation for the next 3 days. Can you help with the logic?

AI: Yes! You can loop through the next 3 days, collect max/min temperatures and precipitation (e.g., from the morning forecast), then plot them using matplotlib. Here's a possible function:

python

def display_temperature_and_precipitation(weather_data):
    # code to extract and plot data here...
Me: Could you combine it all and ensure the precipitation is in mm and clearly labeled?

AI: Absolutely! Here’s the complete version with labels, markers, and line styles for clarity.

### ✅ Summary

- **Core Functions Used**: `get_weather_data`, `display_temperature_and_precipitation`
- **Visuals**: Line plot showing max/min temperature and precipitation
- **Weather Source**: `wttr.in` JSON API
- **AI Techniques Demonstrated**:
  - Problem restating
  - Requesting modular code
  - Pseudocode to full implementation
  - Requesting improvements to visual clarity

Would you like this turned into a Colab notebook or a version that works with OpenWeatherMap and an API key?
