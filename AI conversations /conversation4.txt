Me: Can I see how you’d structure that plotting code?

AI: Sure! Here's a function to plot max/min temperatures and precipitation (morning reading):

python
Copy
Edit
def display_temperature_and_precipitation(weather_data):
    # code extracts the first 3 days, plots temperatures and precipitation
Me: What if the user enters a wrong or misspelled city? I want the script to handle that nicely.

AI: Good idea. The current code already catches request exceptions. You could also check if the response contains expected keys like 'weather' before proceeding to plot.

Me: I'd like to give the user the option to select how many days to view — maybe 1 to 3. Can we make it flexible?

AI: Yes, we can prompt the user for the number of days (with a max of 3) and slice the data accordingly. Here's how:

python
Copy
Edit
num_days = int(input("Enter number of forecast days (1-3): "))
days = weather_data['weather'][:num_days]
Me: Nice! I also want the plot to include a grid, a clear title, and maybe a different marker for precipitation.

AI: Done. You can use marker='o' for temperature and marker='x' with linestyle='--' for precipitation. Add plt.grid(True) and a title like "3-Day Forecast".

Me: Could we add units to the Y-axis label so it says something like "Values (°C / mm)"?

AI: Absolutely! Just modify the Y-axis label:

python
Copy
Edit
plt.ylabel("Values (°C / mm)")
Me: I want to turn this into a script I can share with others. What should I add?

AI: Add a main() function, some inline comments, and use if __name__ == "__main__": main() to keep it modular. You might also add a requirements list like:

text
Copy
Edit
# requirements.txt
requests
matplotlib
Me: What if I want to log all requests and errors to a file?

AI: Add logging using Python’s logging module:

python
Copy
Edit
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='weather_log.txt', level=logging.INFO)
Then log events like:

python
Copy
Edit
logging.info(f"User requested weather for {location}")
logging.error(f"Failed to fetch data: {e}")
