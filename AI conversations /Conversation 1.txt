Me: I want to build a simple script to show temperature and precipitation for a location over the next few days. What’s a lightweight way to fetch weather data?

AI: A good lightweight option is wttr.in, which returns JSON data with current conditions and forecasts. You can access it like this: https://wttr.in/London?format=j1

Me: Great, I’ll use that. Can you sketch a function to get weather data for any city?

AI: Sure, here's a function using `requests` to fetch JSON weather data for a given city:

```python
def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print("Error:", e)
        return None
